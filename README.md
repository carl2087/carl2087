# Carl Ellis


Hi I am Carl I am currently enrolled on a course with Code Institue to gain a level 5 diploma to become a Full Stack Devoloper. I've always had a passion for learning new things and how computers work so I decided to take the plunge on the course and learning to code has become a full time obsession now.
My interests away from coding are Football (LFC), F1, reading books, walking my dogs and my little girl who keeps me so busy it's unbelievable!
